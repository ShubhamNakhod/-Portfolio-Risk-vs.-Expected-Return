# Efficient Frontier: Portfolio Risk vs. Expected Return

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project simulates the **Efficient Frontier** for portfolio optimization by analyzing the **trade-off between risk (volatility) and expected return** using real stock market data.  
It fetches historical prices from **Yahoo Finance**, computes expected returns and covariance, and simulates portfolio allocations to visualize risk-return relationships.

## ðŸ”¹ Features
âœ” Fetches **real stock data** for multiple assets from **Yahoo Finance**.  
âœ” Computes **expected returns and covariance matrix** from historical returns.  
âœ” Simulates **10,000 portfolio allocations** with random weight distributions.  
âœ” Plots the **Efficient Frontier** showing **risk vs. expected return**.  
âœ” Incorporates **Sharpe Ratio** as a color scale for portfolio efficiency.
